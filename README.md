Graphs spotify listening history across the year

## How to use:
1. Spotify allows you to get a copy of one year of personal data. Simply go to spotify.com, log in, hit the top right Profile menu, and then hit Account.
2. Now navigate to Privacy settings using the menu on the left side.
3. Scroll down to Download your data and click the Request button below.

#### Running the code:

run `simplify_data.py` with your spotify myData folder as a commandline argument

optional: add your csv file to `spotify_display.pde` and run it for a nicer looking graph
