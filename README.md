Now navigate to Privacy settings using the menu on the left side.

Scroll down to Download your data and click the Request button below Step 1.

Now, itâ€™s just a matter of waiting a few days to receive an email from Spotify

once you have that data, put the folder location in spotify.ipynb

run all cells of spotify.ipynb to generate a csv file for your top 5 artists

put the path of that csv file in spotify_display.pde

run spotify_display.pde
